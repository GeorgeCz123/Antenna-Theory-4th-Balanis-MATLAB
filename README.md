# Antenna-Theory-4th-Balanis-MATLAB
MATLAB programs from Constantine A. Balanis's book "Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design", 4th edition. 

All programs were taken from the Student Companion Site for Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design, 4th Edition. I just took them and uploaded them to GitHub for ease of use.
